        'Cards typically charge interest daily on your Average Daily Balance if you don‚Äôt pay in full. Pay the FULL statement balance by the due date to keep the grace period. Partial payments usually forfeit the grace period and interest can accrue on new purchases.\n\nTip: Paying down before the statement CLOSE date (not just the due date) can lower reported utilisation and the interest-bearing balance.',

Watch for: transfer fee, promo length, revert APR, and whether purchases lose the grace period on that card. Best practice: park the balance, avoid new spending on that card, and automate payoff to finish before the promo ends.',

Keep old cards open (if there‚Äôs no fee) to preserve utilisation/age, but consider locking them away to prevent re-accumulation. If you consolidate, commit to a fixed payoff plan and throw extra at principal.',
