        'More frequent compounding means interest is added sooner and itself earns interest. For the same nominal rate, monthly compounding grows a bit faster than annual compounding; weekly is a touch faster than monthly, and so on.',

      question: 'What does the Effective Annual Rate (EAR) represent?',
      options: [
        { id: 'A', text: 'The bank‚Äôs advertised (nominal) percentage.', correct: false, rationale: 'Nominal excludes the effect of intra-year compounding. EAR includes it.' },
        { id: 'B', text: 'The actual yearly growth including intra-year compounding.', correct: true,  rationale: 'Yes. EAR captures the true yearly growth once compounding frequency is considered.' },
        { id: 'C', text: 'The lowest possible rate after fees.', correct: false, rationale: 'EAR isn‚Äôt ‚Äúlowest after fees‚Äù. It‚Äôs about compounding, not fees.' },
        { id: 'D', text: 'A rate that ignores compounding frequency.', correct: false, rationale: 'EAR is specifically about accounting for compounding frequency.' },

      question: 'Which typically yields the higher end balance (same nominal 12%)?',
      options: [
        { id: 'A', text: '12% compounded annually', correct: false, rationale: 'Annual is slower because interest is added only once per year.' },
        { id: 'B', text: '12% compounded monthly',  correct: true,  rationale: 'Monthly adds interest more often, so it slightly outperforms annual at the same nominal rate.' },
        { id: 'C', text: 'They are always identical', correct: false, rationale: 'Frequency changes the growth even if the nominal rate is the same.' },
        { id: 'D', text: 'Depends only on the principal, not frequency', correct: false, rationale: 'Frequency matters: more frequent compounding tends to grow more.' },

      question:
        'You have two choices over 5 years at 8% per year: (1) deposit R500 every month, or (2) deposit R30,000 once today. Which typically ends with more?',
      options: [
        { id: 'A', text: 'R500 monthly (total is the same, so results are the same).', correct: false, rationale: 'Totals aren‚Äôt enough ‚Äî timing matters. Monthly deposits start small and build; a lump sum compounds the full time.' },
        { id: 'B', text: 'R30,000 once today (it compounds for the full 5 years).',  correct: true,  rationale: 'A lump sum placed earlier enjoys compounding for longer, usually beating equal monthly totals.' },
        { id: 'C', text: 'Both end equal because totals match.',                    correct: false, rationale: 'Even with equal totals, earlier money compounds longer and usually wins.' },
        { id: 'D', text: 'Impossible to compare without fees.',                     correct: false, rationale: 'Fees can matter, but ignoring fees the earlier lump sum typically wins.' },

      question: 'Which statement about minimum payments on high-interest debt is most accurate?',
      options: [
        { id: 'A', text: 'They reduce total interest dramatically.', correct: false, rationale: 'Minimums often barely cover interest; total interest can stay high or climb.' },
        { id: 'B', text: 'They can extend the term and increase total interest paid.', correct: true, rationale: 'Correct. Minimum-only strategies lengthen payoff time and increase interest cost.' },
